# Welcome to Trunkate üêò!
Trunkate is a custom markdown language I
created for taking notes in class. 


Why not just use markdown? Because:
-- markdown can't draw syntax trees
- markdown can't auto-track examples or citations
- you can't modify the commands easily
- you can't change how things look easily
--u
Why not use a tool like LaTeX? Because (a) LaTeX documents
involve a lot of fancy commands and I wanted to be able to type
stuff out without them, and (b) it's much harder to get something to look
fun and colorful in LaTeX than in CSS. 


Following is a short style guide and how-to. :)

----
For each set of notes you take, you'll have two files:

1. &yourfile.notes&
- &yourfile.html&
--o 

&yourfile.notes& is the file you'll write notes in.
It'll look something like this:

\c this is the file you'll write notes in.
It'll look something like this.
\c

&yourfile.html& is the file that'll display these notes dynamically.
When you navigate to this page, your notes should show up,
and look nice! You are reading a &.html& file right now. Underneath
the hood, this &.html& file looks like this:

\c 
<html>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <script>
        notesPath = 'index.notes';
    </script>
    <script src="syntree/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="syntree/js/jquery-ui-1.8.18.custom.min.js"></script>
    <script src="syntree/js/canvas2svg.js"></script>
    <script src="syntree/js/syntree.js"></script>
    <script src="notes.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="notes.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="content"></div>
    <script>
        loadNotes(notesPath);
    </script>
</body>

</html>
\c

You'll notice that the text I'm writing right now is *not* in this &.html& file.
That's because the actual content of the notes is found in the &.notes& file.
All the &.html& file does is take those notes and make them into a webpage.
So the only things you need to worry about in the &.html& file
are the &notesPath& (the path to your &.notes& file) and the &stylesheet&
(the path to the CSS file which will lend your notes some visual flavor).


But you want to be able to create headings, lists, links, examples, callouts,
trees, and so on. How?

By using *commands*. Some commands will be very familiar if you've used
markdown-style programs before:

-- single-asterisk for *italics*







# To create headings, 
## type one or more hashtags at
### the start of a line

To create a paragraph, just start typing anywhere!
If you press enter X times in a row, X-1 new lines will be created.
(This way your .notes file )

% comments

\e This is the first numbered example. \z

Following is a syntax tree!!!!!!!:


\e \t [S [NP_a That] [VP [V is] [^NP a wug<a>]]] \t \z

Following is another syntax tree!!!!!!!:


\e \t [S [NP This] [VP [V is] [^NP a second wug]]] \t \z

This is *bold*. This is **italics**. This is ***bold italics***. 
This is ~~strikethrough~~. This is _underline_. This is &inline code&. 

Following is an unordered list:
-- something
- something else \f[footnote2!]
- a third thing
    -- a separate new third thing
    - another separate new third thing
        -- a first second third thing
        - a second second third thing
        --u
    - a third third thing
    --u
- a fourth thing
--u

\e This is the second numbered example. \z

And now an ordered one:\f[footnote 1!]

1. something
- another thing
- a third thing
1. a nested 3.1
- a nested 3.2
1. a nested 3.2.1
- a nested 3.2.2
--o
- a nested 3.3
--o
- an un-nested fourth thing
--o

Following will be a summary and some details:

> Nested Summary

This is a c[citation](link). 
This is [another link](link).
This is an &[annotation](that says this).


Following is a horizontal rule:

----

| This is a block quote. 

| This is another block quote, <br> but of multiple lines

\c And this is a code block!\c

\c And this is another code block, 
but of multiple lines!\c

And here's an image, I hope:
