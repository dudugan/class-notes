# David's Class Notes

A custom markdown language (generates html from near-plaintext). 

Desiderata:
- easily interpretable/modifiable CSS
- easily interpretable/modifiable formatting commands
- ability to generate syntax trees from text
- different block types for highlights, asides, comments, citations, footnotes, etc.
- ability to track, reference, and auto-shift example numbers

My syntax tree generator is a modification of Rowan Ackermann's 2024 (forked) generator, which itself is the latest in a long line of modifications of Miles Shang's 2014 version.
