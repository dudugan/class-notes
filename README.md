# David's Class Notes

Markdown can sometimes be annoying and ugly. I wanted to 
make my own markdown system which I can modify as I see fit,
and display with whatever CSS I want on whatever webpage I want.

Also, I wanted to make custom blocks for stuff, 
and examples which are numbered automatically, 
which you can reference and link to without
having to change everything after you add one
more example near the beginning (rghhh overleaf). 
I also wanted to be able to create syntax trees
dynamically in a markdown system and not just in LaTeX -- 
I'm working on that one, lol.
